# stl-to-text
An extremely ineffcient way to render a 3D model in the convenience of the command line.  
Simply pass one or more binary stl files as arguments (best used with only one).  
Automaticly centers, applies a perspective effect, rotates, and scale to fit your current terminal size  
Command line arguments coming soon!
